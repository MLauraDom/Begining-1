<h3><b>What is HTML?</b></h3>
<p>HTML is the HyperText Markup Language used to describe web pages. HTML is not a programming language; it is a markup language. HTML consists of a series of short codes typed into a text-file by the site author — these are the elements.</p>
<h3><b>How many versions of HTML do you know?</b></h3>
<p> There are 6 HTML Versions: HTML(1991); HTML 2.0(1995); HTML 3.2 (1997); HTML 4.01 (1999); XHTML (2000); HTML 5 (2014)</p)>
<h3><b>How does the basic anatomy of a web page look like?</b></h3>
<p>Header, Navigation, Main Content(Articles), Sidebar, Footer</p>
<h3><b>Could you describe the constituting parts of the Web page? Open your favorite website in your browser and try to find these parts in it.</b></h3>
<p>Header
Visible at the top of every page on the site. Contains information relevant to all subsequent web pages on a website (like site name or logo) and an easy-to-use navigation bar system.

Hero image
In web design, a hero image is a large web banner image.

Main content
The biggest region, containing content unique to the current page.

Stuff on the side
Information complementing the main content; information shared among a subset of pages; alternative navigation system; basically, everything not absolutely required by the page's main content. E.g. sidebar.

Footer
Visible at the bottom of every page on the site. Like the header, contains global information like legal notices or contact info.</p>
<h3><b>What are HTML elements? What is the difference between opening and closing tags?</b></h3>
<p>HTML consists of a series of short codes typed into a text-file by the site author — these are the elements.

Tags are used to define where an HTML element starts and ends. A start (opening) tag is made up of an opening angle bracket (<) followed by the name of the element, one or more space separated attribute/value pairs, and for the end (closing) tag a closing angle bracket (>). The end tag consists of a forward slash (/) written before the element name.</p>
<h3><b>Could you describe the Page Structure of an HTML document explaining each element?</b></h3>
<p><b> !DOCTYPE html</b>
 - This tag defines the document type and HTML version.</p>
<p><b>  html </b> 
 - This tag encloses the complete HTML document and mainly contains a document header which is represented by head.../head and a document body which is represented by  body.../body tags.</p>
<p><b> head </b>
 - This tag represents the document's header which can keep other HTML tags like title, link etc.</p>
<p><b>title</b>
 - The title tag is used inside the head tag to mention the document title. <b>body</b> This tag represents the document's body which keeps other HTML tags like h1, div, p etc.
</p>
<h3><b>What is an HTML block element?</b></h3>
<p> A block-level HTML element always starts on a new line and takes up the full width available.</p>
<h3><b>What is an HTML inline element?</b></h3>
<p> An inline element doesn’t start on a new line and only takes up as much width as necessary.</p>
<h3><b>What is the div tag and why is it important? What is the difference between div and span elements?</b></h3>
<p>The div tag represents a container unit that can encapsulate other HTML elements and divide the document into sections or divisions. This element is very important and is primarily used to group other HTML elements. The difference between span and div is that div is a block level element and span is an inline element.</p>
<h3><b>What is the purpose of semantic elements in HTML5?</b></h3>
<p>Semantic elements define different parts of a web page.</p>
