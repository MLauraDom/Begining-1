As I walk through the valley of the shadow of death<br/>
I take a look at my life and realize there's nothin' left<br/>
Cause I've been blastin' and laughin' so long that<br/>
Even my momma thinks that my mind is gone<br/>
But I ain't never crossed a man that didn't deserve it<br/>
Me be treated like a punk, you know that's unheard of<br/>
You better watch how you talkin' and where you walkin'<br/>
Or you and your homies might be lined in chalk<br/>
I really hate to trip, but I gotta loc<br/>
As they croak, I see myself in the pistol smoke<br/>
Fool, I'm the kinda G the little homies wanna be like<br/>
On my knees in the night, sayin' prayers in the streetlight<br/>

Look at the situation they got me facing<br/>
I can't live a normal life, I was raised by the street<br/>
So I gotta be down with the hood team<br/>
Too much television watchin', got me chasing dreams<br/>
I'm a educated fool with money on my mind<br/>
Got my ten in my hand and a gleam in my eye<br/>
I'm a loc'd out gangsta, set trippin' banger<br/>
And my homies is down, so don't arouse my anger<br/>
Fool, death ain't nothin' but a heart beat away<br/>
I'm livin' life do or die, what can I say?<br/>
I'm 23 now but will I live to see 24?<br/>
The way things is going I don't know<br/>

Power and the money, money and the power<br/>
Minute after minute, hour after hour<br/>
Everybody's runnin', but half of them ain't lookin'<br/>
It's going on in the kitchen, but I don't know what's cookin'<br/>
They say I gotta learn, but nobody's here to teach me<br/>
If they can't understand it, how can they reach me?<br/>
I guess they can't, I guess they won't<br/>
I guess they front, that's why I know my life is out of luck, fool
