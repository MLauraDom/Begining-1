     <p><b><cite>Interstellar</cite> is a 2014 epic science fiction film co-written, directed and produced by Christopher Nolan. It stars Matthew McConaughey, Anne Hathaway, Jessica Chastain, Bill Irwin, Ellen Burstyn, and Michael Caine. Set in a dystopian future where humanity is struggling to survive, the film follows a group of astronauts who travel through a wormhole near Saturn in search of a new home for humanity.</b></p>

 <p>Brothers Christopher and Jonathan Nolan wrote the screenplay, which had its origins in a script Jonathan developed in 2007. Christopher produced <cite>Interstellar</cite> with his wife, Emma Thomas, through their production company Syncopy, and with Lynda Obst through Lynda Obst Productions. Caltech theoretical physicist and 2017 Nobel laureate in Physics Kip Thorne was an executive producer, acted as scientific consultant, and wrote a tie-in book, <cite>The Science of Interstellar</cite>. Paramount Pictures, Warner Bros. Pictures, and Legendary Pictures co-financed the film. Cinematographer Hoyte van Hoytema shot it on 35 mm in the Panavision anamorphic format and IMAX 70 mm. Principal photography began in late 2013 and took place in Alberta (Canada), Iceland and Los Angeles. Interstellar uses extensive practical and miniature effects and the company Double Negative created additional digital effects.</p>

<p><cite>Interstellar</cite> premiered on October 26, 2014, in Los Angeles, California. In the United States, it was first released on film stock, expanding to venues using digital projectors. The film had a worldwide gross of over $677 million (and $701 million with subsequent re-releases), making it the tenth-highest-grossing film of 2014. <cite>Interstellar</cite> received positive reviews for its screenplay, direction, themes, visual effects, musical score, emotional depth, acting, and ambition. At the 87th Academy Awards, the film won the Academy Award for Best Visual Effects, and was nominated for Best Original Score, Best Sound Mixing, Best Sound Editing and Best Production Design.</p>

<div class=div1><h2>Scientific accuracy</h2></div>
<p>
Regarding the concepts of wormholes and black holes, Kip Thorne stated that he <q>worked on the equations that would enable tracing of light rays as they traveled through a wormhole or around a black holeâ€”so what you see is based on Einstein's general relativity equations.</q> Early in the process, Thorne laid down two guidelines: 
<blockquote>"First, that nothing would violate established physical laws. Second, that all the wild speculations ... would spring from science and not from the fertile mind of a screenwriter." </blockquote>
Nolan accepted these terms as long as they did not get in the way of making the film. At one point, Thorne spent two weeks trying to talk Nolan out of an idea about a character traveling faster than light before Nolan finally gave up. According to Thorne, the element which has the highest degree of artistic freedom is the clouds of ice on one of the planets they visit, which are structures that would go beyond the material strength that ice could support.</p>

<p>Astrobiologist David Grinspoon criticized the dire <q>blight</q> situation on Earth portrayed in the early scenes, pointing out that even with a voracious blight it would have taken millions of years to reduce the atmosphere's oxygen content. He also notes that gravity should have pulled down the ice clouds. Neil deGrasse Tyson, an astrophysicist, explored the science behind the ending of <cite>Interstellar</cite> , concluding that it is theoretically possible to interact with the past, and that <q>we don't really know what's in a black hole, so take it and run with it</q>

Theoretical physicist Michio Kaku praised the film for its scientific accuracy and has said <cite>Interstellar</cite> <q>could set the gold standard for science fiction movies for years to come.</q> </p>

<p>Similarly, Timothy Reyes, a former <abbr title = "National Aeronautics and Space Administration">NASA</abbr> software engineer, said</p>
<Blockquote>"Thorne's and Nolan's accounting of black holes and wormholes and the use of gravity is excellent."</Blockquote></p>
